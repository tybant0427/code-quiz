simple coding quiz using html, css and javascript 

As a developer in training my goal was to design and to create a simple and easy to use coding quiz game. I did this using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
  The application has 5 multiple choice questions, each question with 4 answers to choose from. The player has 15 seconds to choose an answer otherwise 
  they lose the point for that question.
